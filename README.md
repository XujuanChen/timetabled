Lab 1: Timetabled

Overview

In this project, 

you will build a grid-style calendar with one-hour events that plan out a single week. 

You must create the calendar for someone else. 

This can be a friend, family member, historical figure, role model, or imaginary person. 

Timetables can be informative, humorous, or exploratory. 

For example:


General: Plan a vacation for a friend, family member, or pet

History: A week in the life of a historical figure, timeline of a coup

Psychology: How to adapt to a polyphasic sleep cycle

True crime: The week before a famous crime


## Lab Instructions

Required Features

Step 0: Create a New React Project Using Vite

In this step, we will create a new React project using Vite.


Download and install Node.js


Open the Terminal in VS Code using the menu (View -> Terminal) or the shortcut (ctrl + `)

Navigate to the folder on your computer where you keep github files (it may be named github, 
or you may wish to create a new folder) using the cd (change directory) command.

If you want more info about how moving within the terminal works, check out this tutorial.

Make sure you have added the folder to your VS Code workspace. 

If you don't see the folder in the explorer, right click in the pane and select Add Folder to Workspace... then add your folder.

In your Github repository, initialize a new React project using Vite:

In the terminal, enter the command 

```
npm create vite@latest
```

Name the project timetabled

Select React as the framework (use the arrow keys and enter to navigate the menu)

Select JavaScript for the language variant

Run the timetabled React app:

```
Move into the timetabled directory: cd timetabled
Install the dependencies: npm install
Run the application in developer mode: npm run dev
Open project in the browser. Vite will display a link, such as 
http://127.0.0.1:5173 
to click on or copy/paste that will take you to the localhost port where the project is running.

Pro Tip: if you'd like to stop the server, 
you can use ctrl + c or cmd + c within the Terminal, 
or us the trash can icon in the top right of the Terminal within VS Code. 
To run the server again, simply use npm run dev again.
```
