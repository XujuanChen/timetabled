Lab 1: Timetabled

Overview

In this project, 

you will build a grid-style calendar with one-hour events that plan out a single week. 

You must create the calendar for someone else. 

This can be a friend, family member, historical figure, role model, or imaginary person. 

Timetables can be informative, humorous, or exploratory. 

For example:


General: Plan a vacation for a friend, family member, or pet

History: A week in the life of a historical figure, timeline of a coup

Psychology: How to adapt to a polyphasic sleep cycle

True crime: The week before a famous crime
